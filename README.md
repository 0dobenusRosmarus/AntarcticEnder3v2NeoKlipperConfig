# AntarcticEnder3v2NeoKlipperConfig
This is my personal Klipper Config File & Orca Slicer Profile for the Ender3v2Neo.

Installation Instructions:
My profile was built for the latest Beta of Orca Slicer. Download the latest beta release of Orca Slicer here: https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/v2.3.0-beta2
Alternativly, you can download the latest Official Release here: https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases/tag/v2.2.0
I reccomend going with the latest Beta, but if you run into stability issues, you can try the Official release. In my experience, temporary freezes when opening up some menus is an issue in both stable and beta.

In Orca Slicer, click on the "File" dropdown menu at the top left corner, hover over "import", and then click "import config".
